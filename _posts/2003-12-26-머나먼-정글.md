<a href="http://eouia.net/archives/000565.html" target=bb>Paint it black</a>

건장한 흑인이 따발총을 어깨에 메고, 헬기에 앉아서 정글로 들어갈 때, 이 음악이 흘러나오고, 그러면 전 바로 뿅갔더랬습니다.

"난 내 안을 들여다보았어. 내 심장은 검은 색이더군"

I see a red door and I want it painted black

no colors anymore, I want them to turn black

I see the girls walk by dressed in their summer clothes

I have to turn my head until my darkness goes

I see a line of cars and they are painted black

with flowers and my love both never to come back

I see people turn their heads and quickly look away

like a new born baby it just happens every day

I look inside myself and see my heart is black

I see my red door and it's heading into black

maybe then I'll fade away and not have to face the facts

it's not easy facing up when your whole world is black

No more will my green sea go turn a deeper blue

I could not foresee this thing happening to you

If I look hard enough into the setting sun

my love will laugh with me before the morning comes

I see a red door and I want it painted black

no colors anymore, I want them to turn black

I see the girls walk by dressed in their summer clothes

I have to turn my head until my darkness goes

I wanna see it painted, painted black, oh

black as night, black as coal

I wanna see the sun blotted from the sky

painted, painted, painted black oh baby

painted painted, painted black
