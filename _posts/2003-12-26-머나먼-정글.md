<a href="http://eouia.net/archives/000565.html" target=bb>Paint it black</a><br />건장한 흑인이 따발총을 어깨에 메고, 헬기에 앉아서 정글로 들어갈 때, 이 음악이 흘러나오고, 그러면 전 바로 뿅갔더랬습니다. <br /><br />"난 내 안을 들여다보았어. 내 심장은 검은 색이더군"<br /><br /><div class=box>I see a red door and I want it painted black<br /><br />no colors anymore, I want them to turn black<br />I see the girls walk by dressed in their summer clothes<br />I have to turn my head until my darkness goes<br /><br />I see a line of cars and they are painted black<br />with flowers and my love both never to come back<br />I see people turn their heads and quickly look away<br />like a new born baby it just happens every day<br /><br />I look inside myself and see my heart is black<br />I see my red door and it's heading into black<br />maybe then I'll fade away and not have to face the facts<br />it's not easy facing up when your whole world is black<br /><br />No more will my green sea go turn a deeper blue<br />I could not foresee this thing happening to you<br />If I look hard enough into the setting sun<br />my love will laugh with me before the morning comes<br /><br />I see a red door and I want it painted black<br />no colors anymore, I want them to turn black<br />I see the girls walk by dressed in their summer clothes<br />I have to turn my head until my darkness goes<br /><br />I wanna see it painted, painted black, oh<br />black as night, black as coal<br />I wanna see the sun blotted from the sky<br />painted, painted, painted black oh baby<br />painted painted, painted black</div>
