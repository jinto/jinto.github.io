이건 내 사이트가 아닌 다른 곳에 있는 파일이다. 상업적인 사이트니까 괜찮겠지?<br /><br /><EMBED src=http://www.tvcm.co.kr/tvcf_upload/UpCfMusicIn_mem/Emi_Fujita_-_Wishes.wma type=audio/x-ms-wma autostart=false><br /><br />가사도 이쁘다. 18세 소녀를 위한 가사라고 누군가 말했는데, 어째서 나한테 딱 맞는거지? 태국으로 오기전에 매일 매일 따라부르곤 했었다.<br /><br />난, 하늘을 올려다 보았어요. ~<br /><br />Wishes by Le Couple<br /><br />I looked in the sky and there I saw a star shining so bright above.<br />I closed my eyes and wished upon a star that I would find true love. <br />Someone who needed me, someone to share my life. <br />For a love that would be true, I would wait forever.<br />So no matter how long it may be I will be waiting.<br /><br />One star-brighter than the others.<br />Two hearts-beating for each other.<br />I believe wishes really come true.<br /><br />Love at first sight I knew it from the moment when you say hello. <br />I hoped you felt it too, but we were both so shy-how was I to know.<br />when you reached for my hand, I knew you were the one.<br />We laughed and talked for hours like I'd known you forever. <br />Like a dream or something from a book, true love has found me .<br /><br />One star-brighter than the others. <br />Two hearts-beating for each other. <br />Now I see wishes really do come true. <br /><br />You just have to dream. <br />Nothing's as bad as it seems to be, believe me. <br />Someone's waiting for you to try. <br />There in the sky. <br /><br />One star-brighter than the others. <br />Two hearts-beating for each other. <br />You will see wishes really come true. <br /><br />You can't stop believing - wishes do come true .<br />You gotta believe me wishes do come true.
