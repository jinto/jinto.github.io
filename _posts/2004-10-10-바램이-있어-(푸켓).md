이건 내 사이트가 아닌 다른 곳에 있는 파일이다. 상업적인 사이트니까 괜찮겠지?

가사도 이쁘다. 18세 소녀를 위한 가사라고 누군가 말했는데, 어째서 나한테 딱 맞는거지? 태국으로 오기전에 매일 매일 따라부르곤 했었다.

난, 하늘을 올려다 보았어요. ~

Wishes by Le Couple

I looked in the sky and there I saw a star shining so bright above.

I closed my eyes and wished upon a star that I would find true love.

Someone who needed me, someone to share my life.

For a love that would be true, I would wait forever.

So no matter how long it may be I will be waiting.

One star-brighter than the others.

Two hearts-beating for each other.

I believe wishes really come true.

Love at first sight I knew it from the moment when you say hello.

I hoped you felt it too, but we were both so shy-how was I to know.

when you reached for my hand, I knew you were the one.

We laughed and talked for hours like I'd known you forever.

Like a dream or something from a book, true love has found me .

One star-brighter than the others.

Two hearts-beating for each other.

Now I see wishes really do come true.

You just have to dream.

Nothing's as bad as it seems to be, believe me.

Someone's waiting for you to try.

There in the sky.

One star-brighter than the others.

Two hearts-beating for each other.

You will see wishes really come true.

You can't stop believing - wishes do come true .

You gotta believe me wishes do come true.
